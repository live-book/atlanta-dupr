## Round Robin

The DUPR Pickleball Round Robin event provides an organized way for players to play games and submit their scores to DUPR.

- Players rotate in and out of a game following a round robin schedule created in advanced.
- After each game, players submit the scores to mydupr.com or DUPR app. 
- One player from winning team submits the score; One player from the other team validates the score. 
- The scores of each game is independent of other games.
- The current participating players have approximate ratings ranging from 3.0 to 4.0.

### Switching-Partner
- Players play with different partners from one game to another.

We typically use switching-partner format for the round robin events.


### Fixed-Partner
- Players play with the same partner for the entire event. 
- A fixed-partner team plays with an opposing team that may be a fixed or switching partner team. 

We have started to experiment with fixed-partner format as an option at Piedmont Fitness Center (not at Cross Creek).  The fixed-partner format offers opportunities for players who are interested in
- practicing pickleball skills with a partner
- practicing for tournament(s) with a partner. 

#### Note
Players may request to play as a fixed-partner team.  However, due to various practical reason, we may not able to accommodate the request.  We may have to fallback to switching-partner format when using fixed-partner format is not feasible for a specific event.

## Activities in Consideration


### Drill Practice
During a **drill practice**, we perform 
- drills
- practice games focusing on specific skills
- peer-coaching.

### Game Practice

The **game practice** offers opportunities for players to 
- practicing pickleball skills and strategies while playing a game, rather than wining a particular game
- practicing for tournament(s) with a partner.

We are still working on the logistics (time and location).
